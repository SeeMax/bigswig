      THE TOUR
    </div>
    <h1>
      Imagine your frosty cold pint with a storyteller sidecar<br>
      and you’re imagining<br>
      an afternoon with Big Swig.
    </h1>
      <p>
        By that we mean our tours are as much about the history of Alaskan beers, the masters who brew them and the locals who drink them, as they are about tasting the beers themselves*.<br><br>
        Each tour departs from the heart of downtown Anchorage. During your 3.5 hour adventure, your Big Swig Hoperator will escort you around town and off the beaten path as you explore Alaska’s finest breweries.

      *Okay, so tasting the beers is the most important. Who are we kidding? Big Swig’s our name.

      ABOUT US
    </div>
    <p>
      At Big Swig our philosophy and our outlook on life are one in the same: drink good beer with good friends. It’s really that simple. That’s why it’s important to us that you get more out of our tours than the beer tastings. We want you to leave your time with us feeling like you’ve connected with Alaska and, most importantly, with the people who call this breathtaking state home.
