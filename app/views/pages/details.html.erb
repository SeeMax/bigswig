    <h1>Departure & Arrival</h1>
    We operate 6 days a week, Monday-Saturday.
    <br>
    All tours depart promptly at 2:45 from the pick-up location. We encourage you to arrive 15 minutes early to check in with your Big Swig Hoperator.
    <br>
    The pick-up location is the corner of 4th Ave. and F. St. in downtown Anchorage. If you’re standing by the Visitor Center (the sod-covered log cabin), you’re in the right spot.
    <br>
    After the tour, you will be dropped off at the same corner around 6:30ish. (We say “ish” cause, let’s face it, activities involving beer always run on the “ish clock.”)
    <br><br>
    <h1>What to Bring</h1>
    Please bring your ID with you. You must be 21+ to join the tour. But you knew that already, didn’t you?
    <br>
    Beer and brewery memorabilia will be available for purchase along the way, so bring cash and/or a credit card in case you find a little something that needs to go home with you.
    <br><br>
    <h1>Parking Downtown</h1>
    If you must drive to the pick-up location, note that there are parking garages, paid lots and street parking spots in close proximity.
    <br><br>
    <h1>Swig Responsibly</h1>
    Your safety is everything. If you need transportation after the tour, please talk to your Hoperator. We will be happy to call a cab for you.
    <br><br>
    <h1>Cancellation Policy</h1>
    Hopefully life doesn’t come between you and your brew, but if something pops up and you need to cancel, give us a holler at 907-268-0872 or info@bigswigtours.com.  Cancelations made at least 24 hours before the start of the reserved tour will be eligible for a full refund minus a $6/ticket processing fee. All other cancelations will be charged for the full ticket price.
